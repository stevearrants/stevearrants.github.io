We discuss your goals, audience, and current pain points. I review existing documentation and identify opportunities.

**2. Proposal**  
You receive a clear scope, timeline, and fixed-price quote. No surprises.

**3. Collaboration**  
I work with your team through regular check-ins, using your preferred tools and workflows.

**4. Delivery**  
You get polished, production-ready documentation with source files and handoff support.
