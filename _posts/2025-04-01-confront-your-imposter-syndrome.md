Everyone feels like a work fraud sometimes. Do you fear being “found out” by coworkers? It’s a familiar feeling. Even after doing my job for over 40 years, I sometimes feel like an imposter. I’ve learned these techniques to banish those feelings.

### **Build an Evidence File**

Start a running list of everything you’ve accomplished. Seriously, write it down! Use Notion, Obsidian, Google Notes…whatever works for you. Think about projects you aced, problems you tackled, and those glowing comments from colleagues or clients. Don’t just say *completed release* or published updated documentation. Tell yourself about the *specific contributions and achievements*. Before a big presentation or review, take a look at this file. It’s your private, personal proof that you’re capable, even when your brain tries to tell you otherwise.

### **Flip the Script on Your Thoughts**

When those negative thoughts creep in (I just got lucky—they’ll realize I’m a fake), stop right there. Challenge those negative thoughts. Instead, try thinking things like, “I worked hard for this opportunity,*”* or “The team lead publicly complimented me and my work.”It takes practice to rewire your thinking, but it can seriously quiet that inner critic over time.

### **Talk It Out**

Talk with trusted people, like a mentor, colleague, or friend. You might be surprised to hear that many successful people — even those you admire — have felt the same way. Sharing your feelings can make you realize you’re not alone and offer some valuable perspective. Support groups or professional communities can also be great places to connect with others who understand.

### **Focus on What You Bring to the Job**

Instead of obsessing over whether you’re “good enough,” focus on what you can *contribute*. Ask yourself: “How can my unique perspective help here? or What can I bring to this project?” This helps you move away from self-doubt and towards productive action. Focusing outward naturally boosts your confidence.

### **Growth is Messy — Embrace the Mess**

Mistakes happen. It’s part of learning, even for the pros. When you stumble, see it as information, not proof of your inadequacy. Instead of thinking, “This proves I don’t belong,” ask yourself, “What can I learn from this?” Perfection is a myth, and accepting that takes a lot of pressure off.

### **Set Yourself Up to Win**

Big goals feel overwhelming. Break large goals down into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate task completion as you work. They build your confidence bit by bit. Be realistic about timelines. Remember, you’re seeing other people’s successes without seeing their struggles.

### **Share What You Know**

Teaching someone else what you know is a fantastic way to solidify your understanding and recognize the value of your skills. Mentoring others through challenges you’ve already overcome gives you a clearer picture of your growth. It also reminds you that expertise isn’t an all-or-nothing thing.

### **Separate Feelings from Facts**

Just because you *feel* like an imposter doesn’t mean you *are* one. When those feelings surface, acknowledge them (“Okay, I’m feeling like an imposter right now”). Then, look at the evidence. Are there really any concrete facts to support that feeling? Imposter syndrome is often just your emotions playing tricks on you. Learning this is liberating.
