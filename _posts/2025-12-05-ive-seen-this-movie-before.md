# I've Seen This Movie Before
## What an AI Actress Showed Me About the Future of Documentation

This morning, 7 December 2025, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/theres-a-new-face-in-hollywood-generated-by-ai/" target="_blank">CBS Sunday Morning ran an item about the debut of Tilly Norwood</a>, a fully AI-generated actress. Her arrival brought significant anxiety about the displacement of human talent. But her underlying methodology is similar to whet we're facing in technical communication.

Norwood's creator, Aline van der Velden, didn't simply generate a prompt and accept the result. She engaged in over 2,000 iterations, refining and directing the AI until the performance met her standards. In this model, she engineers the performance.

This distinction is the key to the future of technical writing. While Hollywood debates whether AI is a "tsunami" to be feared or a wave to be surfed, the path forward for technical writers is clear. We must evolve from the talent who types the words to the directors who engineer the context.

### A Legacy of Adaptation
My career began in the era of the IBM Selectric typewriter, long before word processing became the norm. Over the next four decades, I have navigated the industry's transition from command-line interfaces to single-source publishing to the docs-as-code revolution.

Each technological shift triggered a predictable cycle: enthusiasm from early adopters and existential concern from those viewing change as a threat. The current discourse surrounding AI in Hollywood—specifically the fear that "she simply will not replace our people"—mirrors conversations in technical writing circles. However, having navigated every previous industry revolution, I view this discomfort not as a signal to retreat, but as an indicator of necessary evolution.

### The Methodology of "Indefinite Iteration"
The Hollywood source material highlights a critical operational shift: moving from the "one-time thing that's very expensive" (traditional production) to a model where creators can "iterate indefinitely without repercussion".

Technical writing adopts this precise methodology to overcome the limitations of static documentation.

* **Dynamic Media Production:** Historically, instructional videos were difficult to maintain; a minor UI update necessitated a costly "reshoot." By using AI avatars and text-to-speech technologies, we can treat video assets like code: we update the script and regenerate the output, ensuring documentation stays in sync with rapid software release cycles.
* **Agentic Workflows:** Just as modern producers can generate global campaigns without traditional logistical overhead, technical teams are deploying "Agentic workflows" to automate maintenance. We are beginning to chain AI tools to identify outdated visual assets, flag them for review, and draft revision notes automatically upon product updates.

### The Role Evolution: From Writer to Context Engineer
Van der Velden directs her AI counterpart by providing precise emotional and contextual cues; if the input is flawed, the output is "not up to standards". In our field, this role is best defined as the **Context Engineer**.

The objective is not merely to prompt an AI, but to own the informational context that drives it. To ensure AI tools generate accurate, compliant documentation, we must curate the source material (the RAG layer), define the tonal parameters, and architect the information flow.

This is not speculative; it is an operational reality utilizing current tools:
* **Strategic Gap Analysis (NotebookLM):** Rather than manual audits, we employ tools like NotebookLM to ingest comprehensive documentation libraries. This allows for high-level querying—such as identifying discrepancies between integration guides and user manuals—transforming the audit process from manual drudgery into strategic analysis.
* **Self-Maintaining Architectures (Code Wiki):** Tools like Google's Code Wiki signal a move toward documentation that is inextricably linked to the codebase. These systems automatically generate architecture diagrams that update with every commit. The Context Engineer's responsibility shifts to ensuring the underlying code structure is sufficiently clean for AI interpretation.
* **Point-of-Origin Documentation (Cursor & Copilot):** IDE extensions now facilitate the creation of documentation stubs during development. A Context Engineer integrates into these workflows to capture knowledge at the source, eliminating the latency between development and documentation.
* **Automated Governance (Vale):** By implementing tools like Vale, we can automate style guide enforcement. This ensures consistency and adherence to standards without requiring manual editorial intervention for mechanical errors.

### The "Sean Astin" Principle: The Human Safeguard
Sean Astin, president of SAG-AFTRA, articulates a critical distinction between "pushing the envelope" of innovation and "tearing it up" at the expense of quality and ethics. He argues that while we must adapt to technology, we must preserve "human-centered artistry".

This safeguard is where the Context Engineer becomes indispensable to executive leadership. AI models are prone to hallucination, brand drift, and the confident presentation of obsolete data. If you feed an AI bad context—an out-of-date Wiki or unexamined PDFs—it will produce garbage.

Just as a director ensures a performance feels authentic, the technical writer ensures AI output is accurate, safe, and user-centric.

### The Judgment Call
While AI is an unparalleled synthesizer, it lacks the capacity for discernment.
* **Conflict Resolution:** An AI cannot evaluate credibility during a stakeholder meeting where a developer's explanation contradicts a Product Manager's roadmap. It cannot detect the nuance that distinguishes an "experimental" feature from a "production-ready" one.
* **Strategic Trade-offs:** Every documentation strategy involves trade-offs regarding what to emphasize and what to omit. AI can summarize data, but it cannot navigate the political and strategic landscape of a product release.
Defining Completion: AI generation is theoretically infinite. The human professional defines the "definition of done," determining when an explanation is sufficient and when complexity requires segmentation.
### The User Advocate
AI responds to the prompt provided. The technical writer responds to the user's underlying intent.
* **Interpreting Intent:** Users rarely utilize precise terminology. They search for colloquial descriptions of symptoms rather than technical root causes. The Context Engineer bridges the semantic gap between the user's language and the system's technical reality.
* **The "First User" Validation:** We often serve as the initial testers of a product. When we encounter friction, an AI would document the workaround. A human advocate challenges the friction, pushing for UX improvements to obviate the need for documentation.
* **Complexity Management:** Left unchecked, AI tends to document the system's architecture rather than the user's workflow. We ensure documentation remains task-oriented and user-centric, preventing efficiency from compromising the user experience.
### Conclusion: The Strategic Imperative
Organizations are increasingly mandating AI adoption. This presents a choice: view it as an imposition or embrace it as a strategic opportunity.

Success belongs to those who understand both the capabilities and the failure modes of these tools. It belongs to those who can articulate to stakeholders why "AI-assisted" is distinct from "AI-generated," and why human oversight remains a non-negotiable component of quality assurance.

The CBS Sunday Morning video concludes on a cliffhanger regarding whether AI will replace human professionals. For the adaptable technical writer, there is no ambiguity.

We are moving into the driver's seat. After forty years of technological evolution, the journey is far from over.
