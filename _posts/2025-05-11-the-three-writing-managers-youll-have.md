The managers we encounter shape our careers. They can be powerful allies, propelling us forward, or significant roadblocks. Looking back, three distinct leadership styles have marked my professional journey, each offering crucial lessons—sometimes tough ones—on navigating workplace dynamics and, most importantly, taking ownership of my career.

## **Charlie Invested in My Potential**

Charlie was my first writing manager. He combined honesty with insight and support. Charlie was good at spotting individual talents, even when they differed from someone’s current role. Early in my career, he noticed my aptitude and passion leaned towards technical writing, not managing writers.

Instead of pushing me down the wrong path, he talked with me and steered me towards the path of the master writer, the highest level in our company. He supported my development as a master writer, offering constructive feedback and challenging projects.

**Key Career Management Takeaway:** Charlie’s approach highlights how a supportive manager can kickstart early career growth. Yet, even with such a positive influence, he always reminded me that I was the ultimate driver of my career. He taught me to be receptive to feedback, to understand my strengths, and to proactively seek opportunities aligned with my long-term goals. Charlie opened the door; I still had to walk through it.

**Dealing with a Nurturing Guide:**

* **Engage Actively:** Regularly seek their feedback and discuss your career aspirations.
* **Be Open:** Welcome their guidance and be willing to explore new directions.
* **Leverage Their Support:** They are invested in you; tap into their experience.

## **Violet Looked Out for Number One**

Then there was Violet. Her leadership was focused only on her advancement; the team was a stepping stone for her. She made it clear: our main job was to avoid problems that could reflect poorly on her and, ideally, make her shine to upper management.

You never knew when you would be in the firing line. You were there to take the blame and be readily sacrificed for Violet’s ambitions. Blame was often deflected, and credit was consistently hoarded. Working under Violet was a stark lesson in self-advocacy and deciphering workplace politics.

**Key Career Management Takeaway:** Violet’s style underscores the critical need to be your own staunchest advocate. When management prioritizes personal gain over team development, you must document your achievements, build relationships with other groups for visibility, and be ready to move on if the environment limits your growth. This isn’t just anecdotal; studies consistently show poor management is a primary driver for employees leaving organizations. A Gallup study from 2015 found that a significant percentage, sometimes exceeding 75%, of employees who voluntarily leave their jobs do so because of their direct manager, not necessarily the company itself.

**Dealing with a Self-Serving Climber:**

* **Be Strategic & Document Evrrything:** Keep meticulous records of your work, contributions, and any positive feedback you receive.
* **Deliver & Be Visible:** Focus on results and ensure those above your manager see your achievements.
* **Build Alliances:** Network with colleagues and other departments.
* **Be Your Own Champion:** Understand that your manager may not advocate for you.
* **Prepare an Exit Strategy:** If the situation becomes too much to handle, be ready to seek opportunities elsewhere.

## **Julie Was the Absentee Manager**

Then there was Julie, defined by a distinct lack of presence and engagement. She’d checked out, just waiting to retire. Frequent, lengthy PTO absences meant active management was a rare event. When she *was* around, her energy seemed devoted to maintaining a superficial harmony, often at the cost of encouraging independent thought or innovation. Attempts to introduce new ideas or challenge the status quo were dismissed passively.

Under Julie, the environment stagnated. A lack of direction and engagement stifled both individual growth and team progress. We made decisions that were later reversed, often from her latest vacation spot.

**Key Career Management Takeaway:** Julie’s style highlights the importance of proactively seeking growth, even when missing active management. Don’t wait for your manager to offer direction or development. Identify your improvement areas, find mentors, take courses, and volunteer for projects that expand your skillset. Your career development is your responsibility, irrespective of your manager’s engagement.

**Dealing with an Absentee Gossip:**

* **Take Initiative:** Don’t wait for direction; drive your own projects and development.
* **Seek Mentorship:** Find guidance inside and outside the organization.
* **Network for Opportunities:** Connect with colleagues in other teams for collaboration and growth.
* **Document & Communicate Upwards:** Keep track of your achievements and consider sharing them with higher-level management.
* **Consider Moving On:** Explore more supportive environments if the leadership vacuum consistently hinders your progress.

## **Taking Control of Your Career**

Navigating the diverse landscape of managerial styles is unavoidable. By understanding the different managers and their styles — and crucially, by recognizing the imperative to manage our own careers — we can transform even challenging managerial relationships into valuable lessons that help us be successful and happy. The data is undeniable: ineffective management drives attrition. Therefore, being proactive, advocating for ourselves, and relentlessly pursuing growth are essential strategies for enduring career success, no matter who occupies the manager’s chair.
