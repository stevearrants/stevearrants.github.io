When I started as a technical writer as a NASA subcontractor, I was lucky to be hired by a friend I’d met at a horse stable in Tomball Texas, with next door stalls for my Paso Fino and her quarter-horse. “Kat” had a writer bail on her and needed someone. She knew I’d written a master’s thesis and defended a PhD dissertation and that I’d written some instructional materials. So, she was confident I could write and pick up the standards and styles needed for technical writing. I wasn’t so sure. I felt like I was just pretending. I waited for the moment someone tapped me on the shoulder and had security escort me out. But I knew I wasn’t alone.

Imposter syndrome was that nagging voice telling me I was a fraud, even when I had plenty of evidence proving otherwise. Here are some methods I’ve used to combat the negativity, frustration, and immobilizing fear.

## 15 Ways to Beat Imposter Syndrome

### 1. Name It

First things first – what you're feeling has a name, and it's incredibly common. You're not broken or failing; you're human. At some time, nearly everyone feels this. Just knowing this can be a huge weight off your shoulders.

### 2. Separate Facts from Feelings

Your brain might be telling you you're a fake, but what do the facts say? Challenge those negative thoughts by asking yourself: "What is the evidence?" Spoiler alert: there probably isn't any.

### 3. Start a "Wins" Journal

Keep a simple list of your accomplishments – big wins, small victories, everything counts. Got a compliment? Write it down. Solved a tricky problem? Add it to the list. When doubt creeps in, flip through your collection for a reality check. Do this at the end of each day to start and move to a weekly review as your mood lightens.

### 4. See Reality

Instead of "I just got lucky," try "I did it!" Swap "I don’t have a clue" for "I'm learning as I go." Small word changes can make a big difference in how you see yourself.

### 5. Find Support

Talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. Chances are, they'll say something like, "Oh, I feel that way too!" It's amazing how much better you feel when you realize you're not the only one.

### 6. Accept Compliments

When someone says something nice about your work, resist the urge to brush it off. Just say "thank you" and let it sink in. They're not just being polite – they mean it.

### 7. Embrace the Learning Process

Nobody expects you to know everything right away. Mistakes aren't proof that you don't belong; they're proof that you're growing. Every expert was once a beginner.

### 8. Make No Comparisons

Social media makes everyone else look like they have it all figured out. Spoiler: they don't. Focus on your own journey instead of comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone final product.

### 9. Set Realistic Expectations

The perfect doesn't exist, so stop chasing it. Break large, seemingly insurmountable tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. Write *something, anything* to get started. Celebrate the progress, not just the end.

### 10. Picture Yourself as a Success

Do what a professional athlete does – visualize yourself succeeding. It sounds too simple, but it actually works. Practice imagining good outcomes, not just worst-case scenarios.

### 11. Build A Cheerleading Squad

Surround yourself with people who see your value, even when you can't. These are the folks who will remind you how capable you are when you forget.

### 12. Help A Co-worker

Funny thing happens when you help others – you realize how much you actually know. Mentoring or teaching someone else is a great confidence booster.

### 13. Ask for Real, Actionable Feedback

Instead of worrying in the dark, ask for regular specific and actionable feedback. Knowing exactly what to work on feels way better than vague anxiety about everything.

### 14. Know When to Talk to a Professional

If imposter syndrome is really messing with your daily life, it's okay to talk to a professional. Therapists have great tools for dealing with this stuff.

### 15. Remember Why You Were Hired

Someone hired you, chose you, or invited you for a reason. They saw something valuable in you. Trust their judgment – they're probably right.

If you are working with someone you recognize going through Imposter Syndrome, here are some ways you can help.

## Be the Support They Need

**Listen Without Judgment** When someone shares their imposter feelings, don't dismiss them. Say something like, "That sounds really tough. I can understand how you might feel that way. Do you want to talk more about it?"

**Get Specific with Your Praise** Instead of generic "You're awesome," try "Remember when you rewrote that reference on setting up a new client? That took real skill and patience."

**Be Their Reality Check** Gently challenge their negative thoughts with facts. "You might feel you’re not making a difference, but here's what I've noticed about your contributions..."

**Normalize the Struggle** If you've been there too, share it (when appropriate). Sometimes just knowing that successful people also feel like frauds can be incredibly reassuring.

**Create a Safe Space** Make sure they know they can be vulnerable around you without judgment. Celebrate their wins, no matter how small they might seem.

**Suggest Practical Tools** Maybe help them start their own wins journal, or recommend a course that could boost their confidence.

**Just Listen Sometimes** Sometime people don’t want or need you to fix their feelings. Sometimes the best thing you can do is to just be a good listener.

**Encourage Self-Kindness** Remind them to treat themselves like they would treat a good friend. We're often our own worst critics.

**Get Them Out of the Office** Sometimes a change in environment is really helpful. Go for a walk, get a coffee, but go to a place that doesn’t have the office baggage to talk.

Remember, dealing with impostor syndrome isn't about eliminating self-doubt completely – it's about not letting it run the show. You've got this, and the people around you have got your back too.
