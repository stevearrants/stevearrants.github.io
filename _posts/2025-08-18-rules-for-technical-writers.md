1. Drop the attitude. You're not saving the world, you're explaining something.
2. There is no hill worth dying on.
3. Learn to live with compromise and trade-offs.
4. Ask for help when you need it.
5. The things you plan, the things you measure, these are the things that get done.
6. You wouldn’t hike in the woods without a map or guide, so use templates and a style guide when writing.
7. Document everything — every decision and the reasons. You will find you need it when you don't have it.
8. Never come up with estimates on the fly, especially in a meeting.
9. Concentrate on content and not design.
10. Everything you write and publish is a draft.
11. First drafts are crap.
12. Use team members as resources. They're smarter than you about the product.
13. Be a resource for team members. You're smarter than they are about writing. Probably.
14. Let everyone on the team review your documents — and acknowledge their help.
15. Everyone will have an opinion on something they didn't write.
16. Engage with AI to help find patterns and suggestions. **Don't** use it to write content.
17. Check everything for spelling, grammar, and style.
18. Use hyphens, en-dashes, em-dashes, and other typographic conventions correctly.
19. *Edited topics* and *made changes* are not acceptable commit messages.
20. Don't cling to a mistake because you spent a lot of time making it.
21. Documentation is never complete.
