1. Don’t answer emails immediately.
2. Before turning on your work computer, play with the dog.
3. No one cares what you did thirty-five years ago at Microsoft.
4. Drink water. Drink lots of water. As you age, your skin will thank you.
5. If your job isn’t fun, they’d better pay you a lot.
6. Write things down. You **will** forget the arugula at the grocery store.
7. Political opinions are no basis for a personality.
8. Never let your job define you.
9. When in the mud up to your chest for the third time, it’s a great time to quit and do something else.
10. Challenge yourself with new music, books, films, ideas, and people. You will learn something, often about yourself.
11. Use AI as a tool, but also put in the work.
12. Be kind. Always be kind. If you can’t be kind, **walk away.**
13. Live in the present moment.
