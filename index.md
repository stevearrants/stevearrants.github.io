I am a Technical Documentation Architect with 20+ years of experience specializing in modern documentation ecosystems. I help engineering teams transform complex technical information into scalable, user-centric knowledge bases.

* Architected docs-as-code workflows to reduce update cycles by three weeks and improved by 30% document reuse.
* Set up authoring in MadCap Flare, and using Python, move the output to Intercom automatically.

### Core Expertise

* **Documentation Engineering:** Building scalable systems using docs-as-code workflows, API reference generation, and automated content lifecycles.
* **Technical Writing:** Creating accurate, developer-friendly documentation for SaaS platforms, healthcare systems, and enterprise software.

**Philosophy:** Understanding unlocks capability. I bridge the gap between code and user success.
